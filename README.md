Code: for task 3, run cubic_spline.m first and then run the project_task_3 simulink
If you need more data to be displayed (q1 desired and stuff), run simulink and then run project_animate_playback_v3
For the bonus, you can set X Y and alpha positions within the work envelope and the bot will mostly go to those locations.

Do not open the index.html file. It was converted directly from a .doc file, so it is very unoptimized.
