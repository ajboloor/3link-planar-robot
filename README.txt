Report: To open the report, just launch ESE446Project_JagadishBoloor_Adith.htm file on a browswer. It needs
ESE446Project_JagadishBoloor_Adith_files to be in the same directory for images to appear.

Code: for task 3, run cubic_spline.m first and then run the project_task_3 simulink
If you need more data to be displayed (q1 desired and stuff), run simulink and then run project_animate_playback_v3
For the bonus, you can set X Y and alpha positions within the work envelope and the bot will mostly go to those locations.
